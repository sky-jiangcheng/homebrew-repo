# Cinder MCP server (Linux)
#
# The desktop app has no Linux installer artifact (it ships as a bare tarball),
# but the MCP server is a pure Go / zero-CGO binary and installs cleanly, so the
# Formula covers MCP on Linux rather than the GUI app.
#
# Version is stamped by scripts/update-manifests.sh from wails.json
# (info.productVersion) — never edit it by hand.

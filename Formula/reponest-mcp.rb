# DEPRECATED NAME — the project was renamed from RepoNest to Repotory.
#
# This alias exists so a command saved before the rename keeps working. It
# serves the CURRENT release: the previous version of this file pointed at
# RepoNest v1.8.0, so installing it silently fetched a six-versions-old
# build. Use the new name instead.
#
# Repotory MCP server (Linux)
#
# The desktop app has no Linux installer artifact (it ships as a bare tarball),
# but the MCP server is a pure Go / zero-CGO binary and installs cleanly, so the
# Formula covers MCP on Linux rather than the GUI app.
#
# Version is stamped by scripts/update-manifests.sh from wails.json
# (info.productVersion) — never edit it by hand.

# DEPRECATED NAME — the project was renamed from RepoNest to Repotory.
#
# This alias exists so a command saved before the rename keeps working. It
# serves the CURRENT release: the previous version of this file pointed at
# RepoNest v1.8.0, so installing it silently fetched a six-versions-old
# build. Use the new name instead.
#
# Repotory MCP server (macOS)
#
# The MCP stdio server is the AI execution interface for Repotory — the desktop
# app is not required to use it, it reads the same local SQLite database.
#
# Version is stamped by scripts/update-manifests.sh from wails.json
# (info.productVersion) — never edit it by hand.

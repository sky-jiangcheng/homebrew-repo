# DEPRECATED-ALIAS: an alias of a current manifest, not a manifest of its own.
# DEPRECATED NAME — the project was renamed from RepoNest to Cinder.
#
# This alias exists so a command saved before the rename keeps working. It
# serves the CURRENT release: the previous version of this file pointed at
# RepoNest v1.8.0, so installing it silently fetched a six-versions-old
# build. Use the new name instead.
#
# Cinder Desktop app (macOS)
#
# Version is stamped by scripts/update-manifests.sh from wails.json
# (info.productVersion) — never edit it by hand.
#
# sha256 must be filled after each release is published; Homebrew hard-fails on
# a mismatch, which is exactly what we want from a placeholder.

  # The bundle inside the DMG is named after wails.json's `name`
  # ("Cinder"), NOT after the `outputfilename` ("cinder", the executable
  # inside the bundle): the build produces build/bin/Cinder.app and
  # create-dmg ships that bundle as-is.
  # macOS volumes are case-insensitive by default, so an earlier spelling
  # resolved anyway — but a case-sensitive volume would not find it, and the
  # tap's tests.yml asserts the installed path, so the two must agree
  # exactly. The BINARY inside the bundle is `cinder` (wails.json
  # outputfilename); this stanza only tracks the bundle directory.

  # Application Support and Logs paths come from internal/platform; they are

  # preference is deliberately not listed here: wails.json does not set one, so
  # listing a guess would send `brew uninstall --zap` at a file that may not
  # exist. Add it only once the identifier is pinned in wails.json.

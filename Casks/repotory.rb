  # The bundle inside the DMG is named after wails.json's `name`
  # ("Cinder"), NOT after the `outputfilename` ("cinder", the executable
  # inside the bundle): the build produces build/bin/Cinder.app and
  # create-dmg ships that bundle as-is.
  # macOS volumes are case-insensitive by default, so an earlier spelling
  # resolved anyway — but a case-sensitive volume would not find it, and the
  # tap's tests.yml asserts the installed path, so the two must agree
  # exactly. The BINARY inside the bundle is `cinder` (wails.json
  # outputfilename); this stanza only tracks the bundle directory.

  # Application Support and Logs paths come from internal/platform; they are
  # where GetDbPath() and GetLogPath() point on macOS. A bundle-identifier
  # preference is deliberately not listed here: wails.json does not set one, so
  # listing a guess would send `brew uninstall --zap` at a file that may not
  # exist. Add it only once the identifier is pinned in wails.json.
